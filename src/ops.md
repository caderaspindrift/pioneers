# Resistance Ops {#toc-ops .breakbefore}

The basic cycle of a []{.gamename} looks like this:

1. The players create Survivors.
2. Survivors are assigned an Op with a specific mission.
3. Survivors prepare for the Op and get in position.
4. One or more fights ensue on the way to completing that mission.
5. Survivors leave, bury their dead, and recover.
6. Back to 2, until the players are satisfied with the game.

Survivor creation is 
[covered in a previous section](#toc-chargen){.page}; this section
will tell you how to send those Survivors on those dangerous 
missions where they might get killed.

## Op Types {#toc-ops-types}

Broadly speaking, there are three kinds of Ops: **Planetary Ops**
that take place on the surface of a planet or moon; **Space Ops**
that happen in spacecraft; and **Combined Ops**.

Each has their own unique qualities, and in general it's more
fun to have variety in Op types.

Most Survivors' Talents are directly tied to personal-scale
fights, and those should be the emphasis of a []{.gamename} --
but not exclusively.

The bottom of this page has a chart you can use before an Op
to determine what type of mission it will it. Have one player
roll a die and then crossreference the last type of Op you
completed with the die roll, then check the following sections
for specific Op scenarios!

## Travel Time {#toc-ops-travel}

Obviously, the Solar System is huge. With realistic travel times,
it could take years to get from one side of it to another.
If the travel time ever matters, here are some approximate values
you can use.

:::::::::::::::::::: traveltimes :::::::::::
Outer Planet Base Travel Time
---          ----
Jupiter       1 week
Saturn        2 weeks
Uranus        5 weeks (1 month)
Neptune       8 weeks (2 months)
Pluto        11 weeks (3 months)
Eris         19 weeks (4 months)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Travel between Earth and O'Neill Station takes 1d6 hours,
as does travel between Earth and Luna.

For travel within the inner planets -- Mercury to Mars -- roll
1d6 for the travel time, in days. Add 2 days for travel to or
from Ceres.

For travel from the inner planets to the outer planets, roll
1d6 days and add the base travel time from the table below.

For travel between two outer planets, use the higher base travel
time, plus 1d6 weeks.

Travel time between moons of the same outer planet takes 1d6 hours.
