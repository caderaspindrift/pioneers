The basic cycle of a []{.gamename} looks like this:

1. The players create Survivors.
2. Survivors are assigned an Op with a specific mission.
3. Survivors prepare for the Op and get in position.
4. One or more fights ensue on the way to completing that mission.
5. Survivors leave, bury their dead, and recover.
6. Back to 2, until the players are satisfied with the game.

Survivor creation is 
[covered in a previous section](#toc-chargen){.page}; this section
will tell you how to send those Survivors on those dangerous 
missions where they might get killed.

## Op Types {#toc-ops-types .colbefore}

Broadly speaking, there are three kinds of Ops: **Planetary Ops**
that take place on the surface of a planet or moon; **Space Ops**
that happen in spacecraft; and **Combined Ops**.

Each has their own unique qualities, and in general it's more
fun to have variety in Op types.

Most Survivors' Talents are directly tied to personal-scale
fights, and those should be the emphasis of a []{.gamename} --
but not exclusively.

Use the chart at the bottom of this page to determine what type 
of Op a mission will be.

### Planetary Ops {#toc-ops-planetary .colbefore}

On these missions, Survivors are tasked with carrying out an Op on the
surface of a planet or moon. Their gear will be adapted to function in
such an environment, if necessary -- for example, missions to Mars will
include O<sub>2 tanks and filters.

Use the following table to decide the mission paramters for a Planetary Op.

::::::::::::::::::{ .opstable .infotable } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Die Roll     Result
----------    -------------------------------------------------------
     1        **Sabotage Industrial Center** 1 on Earth, 2 on Venus, 3-4 on Mars, 5 on Mimas, 6 in the asteroid belt
     2        **Rescue Crash Survivors** 1-2 on Titan, 3-4 on Oberon, 5-6 on Io
     3        **Liberate a Settlement** 1-2 on Venus, 3-4 on Mars, 5-6 on Enceledas
     4        **Destroy a Pion Base** 1 on Earth, 2-3 on Venus, 5-6 on Mars, 6 on Dione
     5        **Steal Intelligence** 1 from Earth, 2-3 from O'Neill Station, 4 from Venus, 5 from Mars, 6 from Ganymede's Cleomestra Station
     6        **Assassinate a [Cassini](#toc-pion-cassini){.page}** 1-2 on Earth, 3-4 on O'Neill Station, 5 on Ganymede, 6 on Pluto
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Space     Ops {#toc-ops-space .colbefore}

For these missions, the Survivors have to perform a mission primarily in
space. At no cost, a Survivor can swap out their armor for a 
[vacsuit](#toc-armor){.page} without paying a cost in Kit.

Use the following table to decide the mission paramters for a Space Op.

::::::::::::::::::{ .opstable .infotable } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Die Roll     Result
----------    -------------------------------------------------------
     1        **Salvage** 1-2 the asteroid belt, 3-4 near Triton, 5-6 near Pluto
     2        **Escort Mission** 1-2 Callisto to Europa, 3-4 Enceledas to Ariel, 5 Oberon to Triton, 6 Pluto to Earth
     3        **Destroy a [Sakigake](#toc-pion-ship-sakigake){.page}** 1-2 near Callisto, 3-4 near Mercury, 5-6 near Oberon
     4        **SOS Received** 1-2 in the asteroid belt, 3-4 near Jupiter, 5-6 near Saturn
     5        **Resupply Eris** 1-2 food, 3-4 fuel, 5-6 water
     6        **Blockade-Running** 1-2 to Ceres, 3-4 to Europa, 5-6 to Titan
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Combined  Ops {#toc-ops-combined .colbefore}

Specialized gear for use on a surface will be issued to the Survivors,
as per planetary ops. At no cost in Kit, a player can choose to have a 
vacsuit on their ship for this mission, and can switch between that and
their normal armor during a lull in the action.

Use the following table to decide the mission paramters for an Op that
has both Planetary and Space objectives.

::::::::::::::::::{ .opstable .infotable } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Die Roll     Result
----------    -------------------------------------------------------
     1        **Free Important Prisoners** 1-2 on Venus, 3-4 on O'Neill Station, 5-6 on Ganymede's Cleomestra Station
     2        **Rescue Trapped Colonists** 1 on Luna, 2 on Mars, 3-4 on Europa, 5 on Callisto, 6 on Mirans, 
     3        **Liberate a Ship** 1-2 on Earth, 3-4 Earth orbit, 5-6 on Mars
     4        **Evac a Resistance Base** 1-2 on Mercury, 3-4 in the asteroid belt, 5-6 on Callisto
     5        **Broadcast a Message** 1-2 on Earth, 3-4 on Luna, 5-6 on Pluto
     6        **Infiltrate [Genesis](#toc-pion-ship-genesis){.page}** 1-2 rescue a prisoner, 3-4 steal plans, 5-6 sabotage a comms center
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Mission Prep {#toc-ops-prep .colbefore}

Survivors' Health, Impulse, and Kit pools reset before an Op. Each player can
make a prep roll before an Op to prepare for the upcoming mission using an
attribute of their choice. The appropriate pool -- and its maximum value --
increases by 1 for the entirety of this Op.

:::::::::::::::: {.preptable .infotable } :::::::::::::::
 Die Roll   Attribute: Thrust    Gyro        Telemetry
----------  -------------------  ----------- -----------
   1        +1 Kit               +1 Health   +1 Impulse
  2-3       +1 Health            +1 Impulse  +1 Kit
  4-6       +1 Impulse           +1 Gear     +1 Health
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Before each mission, players roll to see which weapons, armor, other gear,
and ships they have access to during this Op.
Any Survivor who has customized their weapon or ship can keep that from their
last Op and doesn't have to roll.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: breakbefore ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Right before an Op, a Survivor can spend Kit (and only Kit) to change out their
gear for another choice on the appropriate table. Survivors without a Med Patch
can also spend 1 Kit to grab a Med Patch -- but no Survivor can have more than
one at the start of an Op; they're too rare among the Resistance and are heavily
rationed.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Travel Time {#toc-ops-travel}

Obviously, the Solar System is huge. With realistic travel times,
it could take years to get from one side of it to another.
If the travel time ever matters, here are some approximate values
you can use.

:::::::::::::::::::: {.traveltimes .infotable} :::::::::::
Outer Planet Base Travel Time
---          ----
Jupiter       1 week
Saturn        2 weeks
Uranus        5 weeks (1 month)
Neptune       8 weeks (2 months)
Pluto        11 weeks (3 months)
Eris         19 weeks (4 months)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Travel between Earth and O'Neill Station takes 1d6 hours,
as does travel between Earth and Luna.

For travel within the inner planets -- Mercury to Mars -- roll
1d6 for the travel time, in days. Add 2 days for travel to or
from Ceres.

For travel from the inner planets to the outer planets, roll
1d6 days and add the base travel time from the table below.

For travel between two outer planets, use the higher base travel
time, plus 1d6 weeks.

Travel time between moons of the same outer planet takes 1d6 hours.

## When an Op is Over {#toc-ops-end .breakbefore}

An Op concludes when the Survivors have finished an Op, or when at
least one of them has died and the players decide to scrub the mission
and return home.

## Post-Op Recuperation {#toc-ops-post }

After an Op, the Survivors retreat to a hidden base to await further
orders from the Resistance.

Any player whose Survivor died during the previous Op can create a
new Survivor during Post-Op Recuperation. Likewise, any player 
who wishes to try a different character can make a new one during 
the Post-Op.

Pools don't automatically refresh at the end of an Op. Survivors who
have points remaining in their Kit can spend 1 point on *one* of the
following options:

1. **Customize Weapons** Spend 1 kit to switch 1 Tag on a weapon to a
   different Tag.

2. **Customize Ship Weaponry** Spend 1 kit to switch 1 ship-mounted weapon for
   a different ship weapon.

3. **Customize Ship Tags** Spend 1 kit to switch 1 Tag on a ship for 
   a different ship Tag.
