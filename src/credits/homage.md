This game is primarily an homage 1970s-era space science and science fiction.

*Battlestar Galactica* in its original, 1978 form is a key inspiration, as
well as the later 2004-2009 remake.
Other influences include the obvious *Star Trek: The Motion Picture*, but also
*2001: A Space Odyssey*, *Space: 1999*, and *Buck Rogers in the 25th Century*.

Around 1975-1977, as a young nerd girl growing up in California, I was fascinated
by astronomy and the *science-based* vision of a future in space portrayed in NASA's 
concept art -- some of which appears in []{.gamename}! -- that is, until a
certain *space opera* movie came out in the summer of 1977.
