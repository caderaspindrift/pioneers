In []{.gamename}, you fight to liberate the Solar System from the Pions,
cybernetic beings who have already conquered the Earth and much of the
Solar System, and nuked the Moon. You know, as one does.

## Resistance Ops

You are part of the **Rag-Tag Fugitive Resistance** trying to free
the Solar System from the clutches of its prodigal electronic children.
With all the other players, you comprise a Resistance Cell that takes
on mssions, called **Ops,** that invariably involve blowing up lots and
lots of Pions. 

If you survive a deadly Op, the most you can hope for 
is a free drink in one of the underground Speakeasies frequented by
the Resistance fighters; if you fail, the best you'll get is one of
those drinks lifted in honor of your sacrifice.
