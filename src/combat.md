[]{.gamename} is a game of violent resistance to the Occupation, so
of course violence is likely to ensue. We call each instance of that a
a **Fight**.

In a fight, the players and the MC alternate turns -- each of the players
gets to have their Survivor do something, and then the MC takes a turn for
the Pions.

## Range Bands

Unlike some tabletop RPGs, []{.gamename} is not concerned with exact position
and distance; instead, participants in a fight are classified as being in *close*,
*mid*, or *far* range, relative to the other combatants. This affects the 
effectiveness of most weapons and can interact with class's Talents.

## Player Turns

On the the players' turn, they can act in whatever order they like, until
every player has had to chance to act.

When it's your turn, you can do any or all of these:

1. **Change your Range Band** by one -- *close* to *mid*, *mid* to *close* or *far*,
or *far* to *mid*. (You can't jump from *close* to *far* or vice versa.)

2. **Make an Attack** against one of the Pions.

3. **Use Your Talents** by paying a cost from the appropriate pool. You can use
   as many Talents as you wish during your turn, but you can only activate each
   Talent once during that turn.

## Attacking

To attack, choose which weapon you're using and which attribute you're using for the
attack -- *Thrust* for a direct attack, *Gyro* for quick strikes or feints, and 
*Telemetry* for a steady, aimed attack -- and pick your targets.

Roll a number of dice (d6s) equal to your score in the attribute, then compare the
hightest die to the total. 

On a **5 or 6,** you hit your target and do damage equal to the Harm rating of your weapon. 

If the high score is a **3 or 4,** you still do the same Harm, but there's also
a *Complication*, which means the MC gets to have the Pions do something -- usually
doing Harm to your Health.

If you didn't roll higher than a **1 or 2**, then you failed to Harm your target, and
the MC can make a move for the Pions.

### Doing Harm

When you successfully hit a Pion with a weapon, you do Harm equal to the weapon's Harm
score, plus other modifiers such as the weapon's tags.

Most weapons do *untyped Harm*, meaning it's not some energy type. Weapons with specific
tags do *burn*, *exploding*, *pulse* or *shock* Harm. If your target has the Resist tag
against that kind of Harm, it takes 1 less point of Harm from the attack. Conversely, if
it has a Vulnerability to that weapon's type, you do an extra 1 point of Harm.

Each Pion is resistant and vulnerable to different types of attacks, so it pays to switch
up your tactics during a fight as you discover how it reacts to each.

## The MC's Turn

During the MC's turn, they can do any or all of these:

1. **Change the Range Band** for some or all of the Pions, relative to the Survivors.

2. Make a **Big Change** in the fight.

3. Have the **Pions counter-attack.**

4. Have the **Pions take moves.**

At the end of the MC's turn, they generate Drops, if appropriate.

### Big Changes

### Pion Counter-Attacks

Usually, the MC doesn't need to specifically have the Pions attack; complications rolled
by the players are usually enough to keep the flow of damage in both directions.
However, a concentrated counter-attack could be the Big Change that the MC chooses during
their turn. 

When this happens, they describe the type of attack or attacks used by each enemy, and
the players can describe how their Survivor is avoiding the Harm. They roll the appropriate
number of dice and check the high number as always; on a 5 or 6, they escape taking any
Harm; 3 or 4 they take Harm equal to half the Pion's Harm rating; and 1 or 2 they take
the full amount of Harm.

### Pion Moves

### Drops

At the end of the GM's turn, roll 1d6 for each enemy that died.

 Roll  Result
------ -----------
1-2    +1 Health
3-4    +1 Impulse
5-6    +1 Kit
