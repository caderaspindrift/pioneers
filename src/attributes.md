Your Survivor three abilities: **Thrust**, **Gyro**, and **Telemetry**.

You use **Thrust** for direct actions -- to solve problems that are
best solved by an application of force, whether physical or mental.

**Gyro** is all about speed and balance. If it has to be done quickly,
gracefully, or both, then you're going to make a Gyro roll.

**Telemetry** covers anything requiring knowlege, whether that's the
specialized knowledge of a hacker or surgeon, or just general
intelligence about the enemy's movement.

## Resource Pools {#toc-pools}

In addition, you have three resource pools, **Health**, **Impulse**,
and **Kit**. At the start of each Op, your resource pools are set
to their maximum value; while the exact value will go up or down
during the Op, you can't go over your maximum value.

**Health** tells you how much Harm your Survivor can take before being 
KIA; each hit by the enemy usually does 1 to 3 Harm.

**Impulse** is your energy, your drive, your momentum. Your class gives
you Talents that you can activate using Impulse.

**Kit** is an abstract measure of how much gear you have.  At the
beginning of each Op, you adjust your inventory by expending points from
your Kit; you can also spend Kit in the field, to represent 
items that you had on you but didn't want to slow the game down with 
time-consuming inventory tracking.

## Rolling the Dice {#toc-dice}

When you do an action, either in a fight or not, state which 
attribute you're using, then roll a number of six-sided dice equal to 
your score in that attribute. Check the highest number you rolled on 
one die against the following table:

 On a...  
--------- ---                                                       
  1-2     The action **fails** and there's a **consequence**.
  3-4     The action **succeeds** but there's a **complication**.
  5-6     The action **succeeds** with **no problems**.
