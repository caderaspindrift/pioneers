# Game Mechanics

You have three abilities: **Thrust**, **Gyro**, and **Telemetry**.

You use **Thrust** for direct actions -- to solve problems that are
best solved by an application of force, whether physical or mental.

**Gyro** is all about speed and balance. If it has to be done quickly,
gracefully, or both, then you're going to make a Gyro roll.

**Telemetry** covers anything requiring knowlege, whether that's the
specialized knowledge of a hacker or surgeon, or just general
intelligence about the enemy's movement.

## Dice Rolling

When you do an action, either in a fight or not, state which 
attribute you're using, then Roll a number of dice equal to your 
attribute. Check the highest number you rolled on one die against
the following table:

 On a...  
--------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  1-2     The action **fails** and there's a **consequence**.
  3-4     The action **succeeds** but there's a **complication**.
  5-6     The action **succeeds** with **no problems**.
