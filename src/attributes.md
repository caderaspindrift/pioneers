## Game Mechanics

You have three abilities: **Thrust**, **Gyro**, and **Telemetry**.

You use **Thrust** for direct actions -- to solve problems that are
best solved by an application of force, whether physical or mental.

**Gyro** is all about speed and balance. If it has to be done quickly,
gracefully, or both, then you're going to make a Gyro roll.

**Telemetry** covers anything requiring knowlege, whether that's the
specialized knowledge of a hacker or surgeon, or just general
intelligence about the enemy's movement.

### Dice Rolling

When you do an action, either in a fight or not, state which 
attribute you're using, then Roll a number of dice equal to your 
attribute. Check the highest number you rolled on one die against
the following table:

 On a...  
--------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  1-2     The action **fails** and there's a **consequence**.
  3-4     The action **succeeds** but there's a **complication**.
  5-6     The action **succeeds** with **no problems**.

### Resource Pools

In addition, you have three resource pools, **Health**, **Impulse**,
and **Kit**.

**Health** tells you how much Harm you can take before dying; each
hit by the enemy usually does 1 to 3 Harm.

**Impulse** is your energy, your drive, your momentum. You can spend
Impulse to activate your Talents.

**Kit** is an abstract measure of how much gear you have. At the
beginning of each Op, you can grab items from the Armory by spending 
some of your Kit; you can also spend Kit in the field, to represent 
items that you had on you but didn't want to slow the game down with 
time-consuming inventory tracking.

### Resistance Ops

You are part of the **Rag-Tag Fugitive Resistance** trying to free
the Solar System from the clutches of its prodigal electronic children.
With all the other players, you comprise a Resistance Cell that takes
on mssions, called **Ops,** that invariably involve blowing up lots and
lots of Pions. 

If you survive a deadly Op, the most you can hope for 
is a free drink in one of the underground Speakeasies frequented by
the Resistance fighters; if you fail, the best you'll get is one of
those drinks lifted in honor of your sacrifice.
