[]{.gamename} is a game of violent resistance to the Occupation, so
of course violence is likely to ensue. We call each instance of that a
a **Fight**.

In a fight, the players and the MC alternate turns -- each of the players
gets to have their Survivor do something, and then the MC takes a turn for
the Pions.

## Range Bands {#toc-range}

Unlike some tabletop RPGs, []{.gamename} is not concerned with exact position
and distance; instead, participants in a fight are classified as being in *close*,
*mid*, or *far* range, relative to the other combatants. This affects the 
effectiveness of most weapons and can interact with class's Talents.

## Player Turns {#toc-turn-player}

On the the players' turn, they can act in whatever order they like, until
every player has had to chance to act.

When it's your turn, you can do any or all of these:

1. **Change your Range Band** by one -- *close* to *mid*, *mid* to *close* or *far*,
or *far* to *mid*. (You can't jump from *close* to *far* or vice versa.)

2. **Make an Attack** against one of the Pions.

3. **Use Your Talents** by paying a cost from the appropriate pool. You can use
   as many Talents as you wish during your turn, but you can only activate each
   Talent once during that turn.

4. **Use an Object** if you've picked up something interesting along the way or are
   carrying a [med patch](#toc-gear-med-patch){.page}.

## Attacking {#toc-attacking .breakbefore }

To attack, choose which weapon you're using and which attribute you're using for the
attack -- *Thrust* for a direct attack, *Gyro* for quick strikes or feints, and 
*Telemetry* for a steady, aimed attack -- and pick your targets.

Roll a number of dice (d6s) equal to your score in the attribute, then compare the
hightest die to the total. 

On a **5 or 6,** you hit your target and do damage equal to the Harm rating of your weapon. 

If the high score is a **3 or 4,** you still do the same Harm, but there's also
a *Complication*, which means the MC gets to have the Pions do something -- usually
doing Harm to your Health.

If you didn't roll higher than a **1 or 2**, then you failed to Harm your target, and
the MC can make a move for the Pions.

### Doing Harm {#toc-harm}

When you successfully hit a Pion with a weapon, you do Harm equal to the weapon's Harm
score, plus other modifiers such as the weapon's tags.

Most weapons do *untyped Harm*, meaning it's not some energy type. Weapons with specific
tags do *burn*, *exploding*, *pulse* or *shock* Harm. 

If a target has a **Resist** tag against a type of harm, they take 1 less point of
Harm from the attack. Conversely, if they have a **Vulnerability** to that type of
harm, they take an extra 1 point of Harm.

Each Pion is resistant and vulnerable to different types of attacks, so it pays to switch
up your tactics during a fight as you discover how it reacts to each.

## The MC's Turn {#toc-turn-mc .breakbefore }

During the MC's turn, they can do any or all of these:

1. **Change the Range Band** for some or all of the Pions, relative to the Survivors.

2. Make a **Big Change** in the fight.

3. Have the **Pions make moves.**

4. Have the **Pions counter-attack.**

At the end of the MC's turn, two things happen:

1. **The MC generates Drops** if any Pions were killed since the end of their last
   turn.

2. **Check on dying characters.**

### Big Changes {#toc-big-changes}

A Big Change means that the battle is shifting in some way -- it might be that
the Pions retreat to a secured location. It could be that a new, larger model of Pion
arrives. The environment could be working against the Survivors -- barriers slamming
down, hatches opening to space, a rumbling geiser erupts.

The idea is not to undo the players' hard-earned victories but to change things
up so that their tactics evolve.

### Pion Moves {#toc-pion-moves}

Each model of Pion has three "moves" listed that describe their usual tactics
in battle. These aren't just methods of attack but give a specific feel to each
type of Pion -- playing to these standard moves rewards the players for learning
what each does, while subverting the moves can be a Big Change itself.

### Pion Counter-Attacks {#toc-counter-attack .breakbefore}

Usually, the MC doesn't need to specifically have the Pions attack; complications rolled
by the players are usually enough to keep the flow of damage in both directions.
However, a concentrated counter-attack could be the Big Change that the MC chooses during
their turn. 

When this happens, the MC describes the type of attack or attacks used by each enemy, and
the players can describe how their Survivor is avoiding the Harm. They roll the appropriate
number of dice and check the high number as always; on a 5 or 6, they escape taking any
Harm; 3 or 4 they take Harm equal to half the Pion's Harm rating; and 1 or 2 they take
the full amount of Harm.

### Drops {#toc-drops}

At the end of the MC's turn, they one die 1d6 for each enemy that died since the end of
the MC's last turn, and check this table.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: drops :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 Roll  Pool        Example
------ ----------- -----------------------------------
1-2    +1 Health   Defeating the Pion gave a quick opportunity to bandage wounds.
3-4    +1 Impulse  The rush of victory is invigorating.
5-6    +1 Kit      Scraps of Pions can be used for a variety of purposes.
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The players can then decide among themselves who will claim each drop. No player can
exceed their maximum in a pool.`

### Death and Dying {#toc-death .colbefore}

[]{.gamename} isn't, broadly speaking, a happy game where the Survivors triumph and
a parade is thrown in their honor. Instead, human civilization is on the brink of
destruction and the Survivors' actions can only delay an end that seems inevitable.
The spectre of death hangs over each Survivor and many are haunted by what they've
seen and done.

When a Survivor is reduced to 0 Health, they're **Taken Out** of this fight and don't
get to act during the Survivors' Turn step of the fight. This lasts as long as they
are at 0 Health.

At the **end of the MC's turn**, each player whose Survivor is at 0 Health rolls a
die and checks the following table.
If another Survivor gave first aid to the dying Survivor during their previous turn,
they can roll a die as well, and the Survivor uses the best value of any die rolled.

:::::::::::::::::: dying :::::::::::::::::
 Roll   Result
------  -------                            
 1-2    Too late; they're **Dead**
 3-5    No change
  6     Miraculous recovery! **+1 Health**
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The Death roll happens *after* the Drops get distributed; if a Survivor who is
at 0 Health claims a +1 Health Drop, they're no longer dying when it's time for 
Death rolls.
