# Mission Control {#toc-mc .breakbefore}

If you're playing as Mission Control instead of creating
and playing a Survivor, you've got an important role in
the game -- but it's *not* to kill the other players'
Survivor characters.

Think of yourself less like the players' opponents and more
like a director or producer -- you give the players challenges 
that their Survivors can overcome, but you're still rooting
for them to win in the end.

In your role, you can control the pacing and difficulty of
the game more directly than the other players can. As a 
consequence, you shouldn't grow that attached to your own
Pions -- they only exist to put up a token amount of 
threat and then get mowed down by the Survivors.

## Rotating MCs {.colbefore}

[]{.gamename} is a very *episodic* game, meaning that there aren't 
really storylines and plots that run from one Op to the next. 

That makes it to switch roles between Ops; for many groups, it
makes sense for a player to take on the MC role for one mission,
and then pass it on to another player at the end of an Op. 

This is how we recommend you play the game -- it gives everyone
a chance to experience the game from two different sides, and
all the players get to make up Survivors! Character creation can
be a fun mini-game.

## The Question of *Why?* {#toc-mc-why .colbefore}

You might notice that nowhwere in []{.gamename} do we
actually explain *why* the Pions are doing this. That's
deliberate, not an oversight!

In the TV shows and movies 
[that inspired this game](#toc-credits){.page}, such as
2004's *Battlestar Galactica*, attempts to explain the
backstories of the villains usually made the shows worse,
not better.

If it's going to make a difference in the way you play, then
of course you can make something up -- we're not stopping you!
But ultimately []{.gamename} just isn't a game about understanding
the motives of your enemies but about breaking evil robots, so
that's what the game does.

We also don't offer an explanation of why the Pions haven't wiped
out humanity and are instead trying to conquerer and control
Earth and her colonies. Also deliberate, and for the same
reason!

If the players bring this up during the game,
just smile knowingly and say something vague, like, "Hmm, that
*is* mysterious, isn't it?" If you're one of those players
reading this and the issue arises later, either play along with
the MC or make up some ridiculous cockamamie explanation. Hey,
maybe it's true in *your* game, right?

## Roleplaying the Pions {#toc-mc-rp }

Unlike many roleplaying games, interactions between the player
characters and non-player characters don't play a huge role 
in []{.gamename} -- the preceeding section explains why!

The [Cassini model](#toc-pion-cassini){.page} are the only Pions
who talk, so when one of those shows up -- and they're found in
most Pion bases -- feel free to play them to the hilt. They're meant
to be the exact opposite of the alien, non-communicative types
that make up the vast majority of the Pions. Cassinis are snide,
taunting, and duplicitous.

You can also roleplay the other Pions without having them speak
directly. Describe how their sensors track the Survivors with
stony indifference. Give them unfamiliar beeps and electronic
squawks as they die; just make sure they're implacably 
inscrutable.
