### Earth

Earth is home to the vast majority of the human race, and is surrounded by large
orbital colonies in Low Earth Orbit.

### Ceres

Ceres is the largest and most populous planetoid in the asteroid belt.
It's a mining colony.

### Enceladus


### Eris

Eris is on the far edges of the Solar System.

### Europa

Europa's colonists live in the frozen seas below the surface ice.

### Luna

Luna is the second most populated colony and is primarily technological work.
It's also the center of communications in the Solar System.

### Mars

Mars is the most populous colony in the Solar System. Its two moons are known
for their shipbuilding.

### Mercury

Mercury is a very hot planet.

### O'Neill Station

Located in the La Grange 5 point, O'Neill Station is the largest orbital colony in the Solar System.

### Oberon

Oberon is the nominal capital of the five colonies on Uranian moons.

### Pluto

Pluto is the second most distant colony and is primary for astronomical research.

### Triton

### Venus

Venus has floating cloud cities occupied by the wealthy above, and gas miners on the lower decks.
