# Pion Spacecraft {#toc-pion-ships .breakbefore}

Pion ships are essentially huge, self-piloting robot vehicles; each is controlled by 
redundant central computers, and has no separate pilot.

The five known types of Pion ships are:

- **Genesis** Worldship
- **Kosmos** Carrier
- **Mariner** Troop transport and lander
- **Sakigake** Artillery Ship
- **Zond** Interdictor

## Genesis {.colbefore}

Only one of these is ships is known to exist, and that's fortunate. Nearly the
size of O'Neill Station, *Genesis* is a mobile battlestation that was at first
mistaken for a small natural satellite, but this is no moon.

*Genesis* is only found in Earth orbit or nearby.

- **Health** Ship-1000
- **Vulnerable** *nothing*
- **Ship-to-Ship Defense Batteries** *close-ship* Harm Ship-2, Burn
- **Pulse Cannons** *mid-ship* Harm Ship-4, Pulse
- **Tracer Railguns** *far-ship* Harm Ship-6, Autofire
- **Moves** Rain death and destruction upon the Earth, direct the fleet, orbit ominously

## Kosmos {.colbefore}

A total of 8 *Kosmos* carriers have been identified by Resistance Intel Officers.
One is in Earth orbit, and another in Lunar orbit. Every human colony under a
blockade -- Ceres, Europa, and Titan -- has a *Kosmos* craft stationed nearby,
and three more prowl the reaches of the Solar System.

Their primary function is akin to an aircraft carrier. They have facilities
for creating and launching the *Zond* attack interceptor craft, and landing
facilities for those and other Pion ships, including hangars for *Mariners.*

- **Health** Ship-50
- **Vulnerable** burn
- **Electrostatic Defense Field Generators** *close-ship* Harm Ship-2, AOE, Shock
- **Moves** Launch interdictors, fire point defense guns, recall Zonds

## Mariner {.colbefore}

*Mariners* are the smallest of the Pion ships, even smaller than the *Zonds.*
Unlike most spacecraft, they *can* be affected by personal-level weaponry;
see the section on planetary Pions 
[for their stats in a personal context](#toc-pion-mariner){.page}.

In addition to transporting troops, *Mariners* also move Cassini-class Pions
and valuable human prisoners within planetary systems. They're found throughout
the Solar System.

- **Health** Ship-2
- **Vulnerable** explosive
- **Attack** *none*
- **Moves** Enter atmosphere, dock with capital ship, reload troops

## Sakigake {.colbefore}

Smaller than the *Kosmos*-class carriers, *Sakigake* craft are primarily weapons
of mass destruction that can attack from the edge of a planet's orbit. They're
mostly used to shell occupied planets that get out of line and destroy
infrastructure on colonies that resist traditional occupation.
*Sakigakes* are found wherever the Pions are actively besieging a colony --
Mercury, Luna, and Callisto.

At least two dozen *Sakigake* are known to exist; they usually travel in pairs, 
with *Zond* escorts. Although they pack a devastating punch,
*Sakigakes* are, relatively speaking, glass cannons.

- **Health** Ship-10
- **Vulnerable** pulse
- **Laser Bombardment Cannons** *far-ship* Harm Ship-6, AOE, Burn, Reload
- **Moves** Swath of destruction, recharge cannons, retreat to a safe distance

## Zond {.colbefore}

*Zond*-class craft are agile and deadly interceptor craft that hunt in packs
like wolves or sharks. They're most frequently encountered near *Kosmos*
carriers or *Genesis*, although they can be found as escorts for any other
Pion craft. 

Their inability to function in any kind of atmosphere is the
only factor limiting their deadliness. Resistance pilots using
[shuttles](#toc-fleet-shuttle){.page} or
[racing yachts](#toc-fleet-racing-yacht){.page} have learned to ditch
their *Zond* pursuers with a dive into an atmosphere -- even one that's
not breathable by humans.

- **Health** Ship-4
- **Vulnerable** shock
- **Pulsed Maser Cannon** *close-ship, mid-ship* Harm Ship-2, Pulse
- **Moves** Concentrate on the leader, break off attack, suicide run
