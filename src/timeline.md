In []{.gamename}, you fight to liberate the Solar System from the Pions,
cybernetic beings who have already conquered the Earth and much of the
Solar System and nuked the Moon.  You know, as one does.

[]{.gamename} is a tabletop roleplaying game for 3-6 players. 
One player takes on the role of **Mission Control** (or, *the MC* for short)
and controls **the Pions** -- humanity's prodigal, digital children
who have returned from the depths of space with technology far beyond that 
of 24th Century Earth.

The each of other players creates a **Survivor** who is part of the **Rag-Tag 
Fugitive Resistance** striving to free the Solar System from the crushing 
**Occupation**.  

## Saving the World {.colbefore #toc-intro}

As member of the Resistance, your Survivor is part of a small cell of 2 to 5
freedom fighters that undertake missions, called **Ops**, that invariably 
involve blowing up lots and lots of murderous robots -- on Earth, in space,
or on one of the **Twelve Colonies of Man** scattered across the conquered
Solar System.

If you survive a deadly Op, the most you can hope for is a free drink in 
one of the underground speak-easies frequented by the Resistance fighters; 
if you fail, the best you'll get is one of those drinks lifted in honor of 
your sacrifice.
