## Class {#step-class}

Your **Class** determines your starting attributes and pools, and
gives you five Talents. Pick a class from this list:

- **Apollo** You're big, strong, and tough in a fight.
- **Mercury** You're fast, agile, and hard to pin down.
- **Gemini** You're smart, clever, and good with technology.
- **Soyuz** You're a jack-of-all-trades and born leader.

The table below lists the attributes and pools for each class.
