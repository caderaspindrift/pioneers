In []{.gamename}, you fight to liberate the Solar System from the Pions,
cybernetic beings who have already conquered the Earth and much of the
Solar System, and nuked the Moon. You know, as one does.

## Game Mechanics

You have three abilities: **Thrust**, **Gyro**, and **Telemetry**.

You use **Thrust** for direct actions -- to solve problems that are
best solved by an application of force, whether physical or mental.

**Gyro** is all about speed and balance. If it has to be done quickly,
gracefully, or both, then you're going to make a Gyro roll.

**Telemetry** covers anything requiring knowlege, whether that's the
specialized knowledge of a hacker or surgeon, or just general
intelligence about the enemy's movement.

When you do an action, either in a fight or not, state which 
attribute you're using, then Roll a number of dice equal to your 
attribute. Check the highest number you rolled on one die against
the following table:

 On a...  
--------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  1-2     The action **fails** and there's a **consequence**.
  3-4     The action **succeeds** but there's a **complication**.
  5-6     The action **succeeds** with **no problems**.

In addition, you have three resource pools, **Health**, **Impulse**,
and **Kit**.

**Health** tells you how much Harm you can take before dying; each
hit by the enemy usually does 1 to 3 Harm.

**Impulse** is your energy, your drive, your momentum. You can spend
Impulse to activate your Talents.

**Kit** is an abstract measure of how much gear you have. At the
beginning of each Op, you can grab items from the Armory by spending 
some of your Kit; you can also spend Kit in the field, to represent 
items that you had on you but didn't want to slow the game down with 
time-consuming inventory tracking.

You are part of the **Rag-Tag Fugitive Resistance** trying to free
the Solar System from the clutches of its prodigal electronic children.
With all the other players, you comprise a Resistance Cell that takes
on mssions, called **Ops,** that invariably involve blowing up lots and
lots of Pions. 

If you survive a deadly Op, the most you can hope for 
is a free drink in one of the underground Speakeasies frequented by
the Resistance fighters; if you fail, the best you'll get is one of
those drinks lifted in honor of your sacrifice.

## Character Creation

Character creation is dirt simple. Follow these steps and you're done.

1. Pick a Class.
2. Choose Your Home Colony.
3. Grab your Weapon.
4. Come up with a Name.
5. Snag a ship.

## Class

Your **Class** determines your starting attributes and pools, and
gives you a choice of Talents. Pick a class from this list:

- **Apollo** You're big, strong, and tough in a fight.
- **Mercury** You're fast, agile, and hard to pin down.
- **Gemini** You're smart, clever, and good with technology.
- **Soyuz** You're a jack-of-all-trades who is pretty good at everything.
