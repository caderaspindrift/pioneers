Six classes of pions have been positively identified, although there may be
more as yet unseen.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Cassini** Diplomat
- **Mariner** Troop transport
- **Rover** Infantry
- **Ulysses** Commander
- **Venera** Air Support
- **Viking** Marine
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Cassini {.colbefore}

The only pions who have verbally spoken with humans. Roughly humanoid,
slender, eight feet tall, and with clear domes over their blinking cybernetic
brains. They're the spokesrobots for the Occupation.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 5
- **Vulnerable** pulse
- **Finger Lasers** *close, mid* Harm 2, Burn 
- **Moves** Issue threats, call for help, strategic withdrawal
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Mariner {.colbefore}

The largest of the non-vessel Pions, they're less like individual robots 
and more like small shuttlecraft used as troop transports.
Their rectangular bodies are the size of a large 
truck and have fore- and aft-facing cannons. 

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 20 (Ship-2)
- **Vulnerable** explosive
- **Thunder Cannons** *mid, far* Harm 4, Exploding
- **Moves** Lift off, disgorge troops, hover precipitously
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Rover 

These pions are about the size of a large dog; their four limbs are made to 
fold inward, or extend to maneuver over obstacles. They're the rank-and-file
infantry of the Occupation.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 4
- **Vulnerable** explosive
- **Slugthrowers** *close, mid* Harm 1
- **Laser Torch** *close* Harm 1
- **Moves** Swarm the humans, obey orders, breach defenses
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Ulysses 

The Ulysses pions are the command-and-control leaders of pion ground forces,
including the rovers and the vikings. They're shaped like six-legged mechanical
spiders about the size of a small car, with sensors in all directions.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 7
- **Vulnerable** pulse
- **Micro-scramjet Swarms** *all* Harm 4, Exploding
- **Moves** Analyze tactics, coordinate troops, missile lock
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Venera {.colbefore}

Venera pions are the air support for ground operations, offering eye-in-the-sky
intelligence reports to those on the ground. They look the most like old NASA
probes of any pions, resembling armored viking orbiters.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 6
- **Vulnerable** burn
- **Focused Microwave Pulse** *close, mid* Harm 2, Burn
- **Moves** Transmit tactical telemetry, evasive maneuvers, crash and burn
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Viking 

The viking-class pions are the most feared by resistance fighters, as they're
the heavy troopers of the Ooccupation. Reinforced weapon mounts surround a cylindrical
central body mounted on 12 flexible legs of variegrated size.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 9
- **Vulnerable** *nothing known*
- **Overkill Onslaught** *close, mid* Harm 5
