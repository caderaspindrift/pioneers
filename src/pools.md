# Resource Pools {.colbefore}

In addition, you have three resource pools, **Health**, **Impulse**,
and **Kit**.

**Health** tells you how much Harm you can take before dying; each
hit by the enemy usually does 1 to 3 Harm.

**Impulse** is your energy, your drive, your momentum. You can spend
Impulse to activate your Talents.

**Kit** is an abstract measure of how much gear you have. At the
beginning of each Op, you can grab items from the Armory by spending 
some of your Kit; you can also spend Kit in the field, to represent 
items that you had on you but didn't want to slow the game down with 
time-consuming inventory tracking.
