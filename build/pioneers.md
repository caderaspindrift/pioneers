In []{.gamename}, you fight to liberate the Solar System from the Pions,
cybernetic beings who have already conquered the Earth and much of the
Solar System and nuked the Moon.  You know, as one does.

## Saving the World {.colbefore #toc-intro}

[]{.gameguide} is a tabletop roleplaying game for 3-6 players. 
One player takes on the role of **Mission Control** (or, *the MC* for short)
and controls **the Pions** -- humanity's prodigal, digital children
who have returned from the depths of space with technology far beyond that 
of 24th Century Earth.

The each of other players creates a **Survivor** who is part of the **Rag-Tag 
Fugitive Resistance** striving to free the Solar System from the crushing 
**Occupation**.  

As member of the Resistance, your Survivor is part of a small cell of 2 to 5
freedom fighters that undertake missions, called **Ops**, that invariably 
involve blowing up lots and lots of murderous robots -- on Earth, in space,
or on one of the **Twelve Colonies of Man** scattered across the conquered
Solar System.

If you survive a deadly Op, the most you can hope for is a free drink in 
one of the underground speak-easies frequented by the Resistance fighters; 
if you fail, the best you'll get is one of those drinks lifted in honor of 
your sacrifice.

## Three Attributes {#toc-attributes .colbefore}

> "In retrospect, putting a map showing how to get back to Earth on those 
> old-fashioned space probes probably wasn't the smartest idea."
> [*An Oral History of the 2320-2324 Pioneer War*]{.credit}

Your Survivor three abilities: **Thrust**, **Gyro**, and **Telemetry**.

You use **Thrust** for direct actions -- to solve problems that are
best solved by an application of force, whether physical or mental.

**Gyro** is all about speed and balance. If it has to be done quickly,
gracefully, or both, then you're going to make a Gyro roll.

**Telemetry** covers anything requiring knowlege, whether that's the
specialized knowledge of a hacker or surgeon, or just general
intelligence about the enemy's movement.

### Resource Pools {.colbefore #toc-pools}

In addition, you have three resource pools, **Health**, **Impulse**,
and **Kit**. At the start of each Op, your resource pools are set
to their maximum value; while the exact value will go up or down
during the Op, you can't go over your maximum value.

**Health** tells you how much Harm your Survivor can take before being 
KIA; each hit by the enemy usually does 1 to 3 Harm.

**Impulse** is your energy, your drive, your momentum. Your class gives
you Talents that you can activate using Impulse.

**Kit** is an abstract measure of how much gear you have.  At the
beginning of each Op, you adjust your inventory by expending points from
your Kit; you can also spend Kit in the field, to represent 
items that you had on you but didn't want to slow the game down with 
time-consuming inventory tracking.

### Rolling the Dice {.colbefore #toc-dice}

When you do an action, either in a fight or not, state which 
attribute you're using, then roll a number of six-sided dice equal to 
your score in that attribute. Check the highest number you rolled on 
one die against the following table:

 On a...  
--------- ---                                                       
  1-2     The action **fails** and there's a **consequence**.
  3-4     The action **succeeds** but there's a **complication**.
  5-6     The action **succeeds** with **no problems**.


## Survivor Creation {#toc-chargen .colbefore .nospan}

Creating a Survivor is dirt simple. There are just five steps,
then you're done.  
You can fill in the fields on the Survivor
Record, which is a sheet et for recording your character's 
details.

1. [Pick a Class.](#step-class){.page}
2. [Choose Your Home Colony.](#step-colony){.page}
3. [Grab your Gear.](#step-gear){.page}
4. [Snag a ship.](#step-ship){.page}
5. Come up with a Name.

Instructions for playing the MC [come later in the rules](#the-mc).
