In []{.gamename}, you fight to liberate the Solar System from the Pions,
cybernetic beings who have already conquered the Earth and much of the
Solar System and nuked the Moon.  You know, as one does.

## Saving the World {#toc-intro}

[]{.gameguide} is a tabletop roleplaying game for 3-6 players. 
One player takes on the role of **Mission Control** (or, *the MC* for short)
and controls **the Pions** -- humanity's prodigal, digital children
who have returned from the depths of space with technology far beyond that 
of 24th Century Earth.

The each of other players creates a **Survivor** who is part of the **Rag-Tag 
Fugitive Resistance** striving to free the Solar System from the crushing 
**Occupation**.  

As member of the Resistance, your Survivor is part of a small cell of 2 to 5
freedom fighters that undertake missions, called **Ops**, that invariably 
involve blowing up lots and lots of murderous robots -- on Earth, in space,
or on one of the **Twelve Colonies of Man** scattered across the conquered
Solar System.

If you survive a deadly Op, the most you can hope for is a free drink in 
one of the underground speak-easies frequented by the Resistance fighters; 
if you fail, the best you'll get is one of those drinks lifted in honor of 
your sacrifice.

## Game Mechanics {#toc-attributes .breakbefore}

> "In retrospect, putting a map showing how to get back to Earth on those 
> old-fashioned space probes probably wasn't the smartest idea."
> [*An Oral History of the 2320-2324 Pioneer War*]{.credit}

Your Survivor three abilities: **Thrust**, **Gyro**, and **Telemetry**.

You use **Thrust** for direct actions -- to solve problems that are
best solved by an application of force, whether physical or mental.

**Gyro** is all about speed and balance. If it has to be done quickly,
gracefully, or both, then you're going to make a Gyro roll.

**Telemetry** covers anything requiring knowlege, whether that's the
specialized knowledge of a hacker or surgeon, or just general
intelligence about the enemy's movement.

### Resource Pools {#toc-pools}

In addition, you have three resource pools, **Health**, **Impulse**,
and **Kit**. At the start of each Op, your resource pools are set
to their maximum value; while the exact value will go up or down
during the Op, you can't go over your maximum value.

**Health** tells you how much Harm your Survivor can take before being 
KIA; each hit by the enemy usually does 1 to 3 Harm.

**Impulse** is your energy, your drive, your momentum. Your class gives
you Talents that you can activate using Impulse.

**Kit** is an abstract measure of how much gear you have.  At the
beginning of each Op, you adjust your inventory by expending points from
your Kit; you can also spend Kit in the field, to represent 
items that you had on you but didn't want to slow the game down with 
time-consuming inventory tracking.

### Rolling the Dice {#toc-dice}

When you do an action, either in a fight or not, state which 
attribute you're using, then roll a number of six-sided dice equal to 
your score in that attribute. Check the highest number you rolled on 
one die against the following table:

 On a...  
--------- ---                                                       
  1-2     The action **fails** and there's a **consequence**.
  3-4     The action **succeeds** but there's a **complication**.
  5-6     The action **succeeds** with **no problems**.

Creating a Survivor is dirt simple. There are just five steps,
then you're done.  
You can fill in the fields on the Survivor
Record, which is a sheet et for recording your character's 
details.

1. [Pick a Class.](#step-class){.page}
2. [Choose Your Home Colony.](#step-colony){.page}
3. [Grab your Gear.](#step-gear){.page}
4. [Snag a ship.](#step-ship){.page}
5. Come up with a Name.

Instructions for playing the MC [come later in the rules](#the-mc).

## Class {#step-class}

Your **Class** determines your attributes and pools, your talents,

In the 24th Century, humanity has long since colonized the
Solar System, building both surface bases on inhospitable planets and
moons, and orbiting colonies above them.

Choose one of the following origins for your Survivor, and note it
on your Survivor Record.

- **Callistoan** You're from Jupiter's moon Callisto.  *+1 Ship-Telemetry on Liquid-Hydrogen Tankers.*

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Gear {.breakbefore #step-gear}

When you first create your Survivor, you're given a suit of armor and
two or three weapons, as shown on the page for your class. 

If you don't like the results you rolled, you can spend one Kit before 
your mission to change those to another option on your list.

After each Op you have the option to spend 1 Kit each to change your armor
or weapon for any others, including those that aren't on your starting
gear list.

### Armor {#toc-armor}

Armor is *ablative*. meaning that when it protects you, it becomes weaker.
A new suit of armor starts out with a full set of charges, and you can repair
it between Ops to reset those charges to their maximum values.

::::::::::::: {.infolist .breakable } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Assault Armor** Ignore 1 Harm per attack (6 charges)
- **Energy Siphon** Ignore Burn, Pulse, or Shock Harm (3 charges)
- **Stealthsuit** Ignore Harm from *far* sources (3 charges)
- **Tactical Vest** Ignore Harm from *close* sources (3 charges)
- **Vacsuit** You don't get KIA if your ship is destroyed (1 charge)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::: {.infolist .breakable} ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Weapons {#toc-weapons}

Each weapon lists the ranges at which it can be used -- *close*, *mid*,
and *far* -- as well as the damage and any Weapon Tags (see below).

- **Autolaser**         *mid* Harm 2, Autofire, Burn
- **Autorifle**         *mid* Harm 1, Autofire, Heavy
- **Bow**               *mid, far* Harm 1, Reload
- **Flamethrower**      *close* Harm 2, AOE, Burn
- **Frag Grenade**      *close* Harm 1, Exploding, Friendly-Fire, Single-Use
- **Grenade Mortar**    *mid* Harm 2, Exploding, Reload, Tactical
- **Laser Grenade**     *close* Harm 1, AOE, Burn, Friendly-Fire, Single-Use
- **Laser Pistol**      *close* Harm 1, Handgun, Burn
- **Laser Rifle**       *mid, far* Harm 2, Burn
- **Pulse Grenade**     *close* Harm 1, AOE, EMP, Friendly-Fire, Single-Use
- **Pulse Pistol**      *close* Harm 1, EMP, Handgun
- **Pulse Rifle**       *mid* Harm 2, EMP, Heavy
- **Rocket Launcher**   *mid* Harm 3, Exploding, Heavy, Reload
- **SMG**               *close, mid* Harm 1, Autofire
- **Shotgun**           *close* Harm 2
- **Slug Pistol**       *close* Harm 1, Handgun
- **Slug Rifle**        *mid, far* Harm 2, Heavy
- **Sniper Rifle**      *far* Harm 2, Scope, Tactical
- **Taser Pistol**      *close* Harm 1, Handgun, Shock, Tactical
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
::::::::::::: {.infolist .breakable } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Weapon Tags {#toc-weapon-tags}

These tags apply to both personal weaponry and weapons on spacecraft
(#step-ship){.page}.

- **AOE** Affects multiple targets.
- **Autofire** Can hit multiple targets.
- **Burn** Does burn damage.
- **EMP**  Does pulse damage.
- **Exploding** Does explosive damage against multiple targets.
- **Friendly Fire** Targets allies in the range band.
- **Handgun** +1 Harm when fired with Gyro.
- **Heavy** +1 Harm when fired with Thrust.
- **Piercing** Ignores Resist.
- **Reload** Sometimes requires reloading.
- **Scope** Does +1 Harm if you remain stationary when firing.
- **Self-Destructive** Damages wielder.
- **Single-Use** You can only use this weapon once.
- **Shock** Does shock damage.
- **Tactical** Does +1 Harm when fired with Telemetry.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::: { .infolist } ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
### Other Items {#toc-gear-other}

[]{.gamename} isn't a subtle game. You get a mission, go in, kill robots,
and get out. There's not a lot of room for the niceties -- your Survivors
are Resistance freedom fighters constantly on the run. There's not a need
for specialized equipment.
We assume your Survivor has the basics to do their jobs:

- **Clothes and a Backpack**
- **A Toolkit** for basic repairs
- **Water/Rations** dried "astronaut food"
- **A Map** of the mission area

If you need anything else, you can spend 1 Kit before or during the
mission to say you brought it with you.

## Fights {#toc-fights .breakbefore}

> "I fuckin' hate these goddamn space probes. 
> 'Explore the universe and report back' -- fuck that, does us
> no damn good down here on planet Earth. Earth first, always."
> [*An Oral History of the 2320-2324 Pioneer War*]{.credit}


[]{.gamename} is a game of violent resistance to the Occupation, so
of course violence is likely to ensue. We call each instance of that a
a **Fight**.

In a fight, the players and the MC alternate turns -- each of the players
gets to have their Survivor do something, and then the MC takes a turn for
the Pions.

### Range Bands {#toc-range}

Unlike some tabletop RPGs, []{.gamename} is not concerned with exact position
and distance; instead, participants in a fight are classified as being in *close*,
*mid*, or *far* range, relative to the other combatants. This affects the 
effectiveness of most weapons and can interact with class's Talents.

### Player Turns {#toc-turn-player}

On the the players' turn, they can act in whatever order they like, until
every player has had to chance to act.

When it's your turn, you can do any or all of these:

1. **Change your Range Band** by one -- *close* to *mid*, *mid* to *close* or *far*,
or *far* to *mid*. (You can't jump from *close* to *far* or vice versa.)

2. **Make an Attack** against one of the Pions.

3. **Use Your Talents** by paying a cost from the appropriate pool. You can use
   as many Talents as you wish during your turn, but you can only activate each
   Talent once during that turn.

### Attacking {#toc-attacking}

To attack, choose which weapon you're using and which attribute you're using for the
attack -- *Thrust* for a direct attack, *Gyro* for quick strikes or feints, and 
*Telemetry* for a steady, aimed attack -- and pick your targets.

Roll a number of dice (d6s) equal to your score in the attribute, then compare the
hightest die to the total. 

On a **5 or 6,** you hit your target and do damage equal to the Harm rating of your weapon. 

If the high score is a **3 or 4,** you still do the same Harm, but there's also
a *Complication*, which means the MC gets to have the Pions do something -- usually
doing Harm to your Health.

If you didn't roll higher than a **1 or 2**, then you failed to Harm your target, and
the MC can make a move for the Pions.

#### Doing Harm {#toc-harm}

When you successfully hit a Pion with a weapon, you do Harm equal to the weapon's Harm
score, plus other modifiers such as the weapon's tags.

Most weapons do *untyped Harm*, meaning it's not some energy type. Weapons with specific
tags do *burn*, *exploding*, *pulse* or *shock* Harm. 

If a target has a **Resist** tag against a type of harm, they take 1 less point of
Harm from the attack. Conversely, if they have a **Vulnerability** to that type of
harm, they take an extra 1 point of Harm.

Each Pion is resistant and vulnerable to different types of attacks, so it pays to switch
up your tactics during a fight as you discover how it reacts to each.

### The MC's Turn {#toc-turn-mc}

During the MC's turn, they can do any or all of these:

1. **Change the Range Band** for some or all of the Pions, relative to the Survivors.

2. Make a **Big Change** in the fight.

3. Have the **Pions counter-attack.**

4. Have the **Pions take moves.**

At the end of the MC's turn, they generate Drops, if appropriate.

#### Big Changes {#toc-big-changes}

#### Pion Counter-Attacks {#toc-counter-attack}

Usually, the MC doesn't need to specifically have the Pions attack; complications rolled
by the players are usually enough to keep the flow of damage in both directions.
However, a concentrated counter-attack could be the Big Change that the MC chooses during
their turn. 

When this happens, they describe the type of attack or attacks used by each enemy, and
the players can describe how their Survivor is avoiding the Harm. They roll the appropriate
number of dice and check the high number as always; on a 5 or 6, they escape taking any
Harm; 3 or 4 they take Harm equal to half the Pion's Harm rating; and 1 or 2 they take
the full amount of Harm.

#### Pion Moves {#toc-pion-moves}

#### Drops {#toc-drops}

At the end of the GM's turn, roll 1d6 for each enemy that died.

 Roll  Result
------ -----------
1-2    +1 Health
3-4    +1 Impulse
5-6    +1 Kit

> [*An Oral History of the 2320-2324 Pioneer War*]{.credit}

Six classes of pions have been positively identified, although there may be
more as yet unseen.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Cassini** Diplomat
- **Mariner** Troop transport
- **Rover** Infantry
- **Ulysses** Commander
- **Venera** Air Support
- **Viking** Marine
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Cassini {.colbefore}

The only pions who have verbally spoken with humans. Roughly humanoid,
slender, eight feet tall, and with clear domes over their blinking cybernetic
brains. They're the spokesrobots for the Occupation.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 5
- **Vulnerable** pulse
- **Finger Lasers** *close, mid* Harm 2, Burn 
- **Moves** Issue threats, call for help, strategic withdrawal
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Mariner {.colbefore}

The largest of the non-vessel Pions, they're less like individual robots 
and more like small shuttlecraft used as troop transports.
Their rectangular bodies are the size of a large 
truck and have fore- and aft-facing cannons. 

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 20 (Ship-2)
- **Vulnerable** explosive
- **Thunder Cannons** *mid, far* Harm 4, Exploding
- **Moves** Lift off, disgorge troops, hover precipitously
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

fold inward, or extend to maneuver over obstacles. They're the rank-and-file
infantry of the Occupation.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 4
- **Vulnerable** explosive
- **Slugthrowers** *close, mid* Harm 1

The viking-class pions are the most feared by resistance fighters, as they're
the heavy troopers of the Ooccupation. Reinforced weapon mounts surround a cylindrical
central body mounted on 12 flexible legs of variegrated size.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 9
- **Vulnerable** *nothing known*

## Mission Control {#toc-mc}

[]{.lorem}


## Resistance Ops {#toc-ops .breakbefore}

[]{.lorem}

### Op Types {#toc-op-types}

There are three basic Op types:

- Planetary Ops
- Orbital Ops
- Combined Ops

### Preparing for the Mission {#toc-op-prep}

### Travel Time {#toc-op-travel}

Obviously, the Solar System is huge. With realistic travel times,
it could take years to get from one side of it to another.
If the travel time ever matters, here are some approximate values
you can use.

:::::::::::::::::::: traveltimes :::::::::::
Outer Planet Base Travel Time
---          ----
Jupiter       1 week
Saturn        2 weeks
Uranus        5 weeks (1 month)
Neptune       8 weeks (2 months)
Pluto        11 weeks (3 months)
Eris         19 weeks (4 months)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Travel between Earth and O'Neill Station takes 1d6 hours,
as does travel between Earth and Luna.

For travel within the inner planets -- Mercury to Mars -- roll
1d6 for the travel time, in days. Add 2 days for travel to or
from Ceres.

For travel from the inner planets to the outer planets, roll
1d6 days and add the base travel time from the table below.

For travel between two outer planets, use the higher base travel
time, plus 1d6 weeks.

- Travel time between moons of the same outer planet takes 1d6 hours.
