In []{.gamename}, you fight to liberate the Solar System from the Pions,
cybernetic beings who have already conquered the Earth and much of the
Solar System, and nuked the Moon. You know, as one does.

## Resistance Ops

You are part of the **Rag-Tag Fugitive Resistance** trying to free
the Solar System from the clutches of its prodigal electronic children.
With all the other players, you comprise a Resistance Cell that takes
on mssions, called **Ops,** that invariably involve blowing up lots and
lots of Pions. 

If you survive a deadly Op, the most you can hope for 
is a free drink in one of the underground Speakeasies frequented by
the Resistance fighters; if you fail, the best you'll get is one of
those drinks lifted in honor of your sacrifice.


## Game Mechanics

You have three abilities: **Thrust**, **Gyro**, and **Telemetry**.

You use **Thrust** for direct actions -- to solve problems that are
best solved by an application of force, whether physical or mental.

**Gyro** is all about speed and balance. If it has to be done quickly,
gracefully, or both, then you're going to make a Gyro roll.

**Telemetry** covers anything requiring knowlege, whether that's the
specialized knowledge of a hacker or surgeon, or just general
intelligence about the enemy's movement.

### Dice Rolling

When you do an action, either in a fight or not, state which 
attribute you're using, then Roll a number of dice equal to your 
attribute. Check the highest number you rolled on one die against
the following table:

 On a...  
--------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  1-2     The action **fails** and there's a **consequence**.
  3-4     The action **succeeds** but there's a **complication**.
  5-6     The action **succeeds** with **no problems**.


## Resource Pools {.colbefore}

In addition, you have three resource pools, **Health**, **Impulse**,
and **Kit**.

**Health** tells you how much Harm you can take before dying; each
hit by the enemy usually does 1 to 3 Harm.

**Impulse** is your energy, your drive, your momentum. You can spend
Impulse to activate your Talents.

**Kit** is an abstract measure of how much gear you have. At the
beginning of each Op, you can grab items from the Armory by spending 
some of your Kit; you can also spend Kit in the field, to represent 
items that you had on you but didn't want to slow the game down with 
time-consuming inventory tracking.

## Character Creation {.breakbefore}

Character creation is dirt simple. Follow these steps and you're done.

1. Pick a Class.
2. Choose Your Home Colony.
3. Grab your Weapon.
4. Come up with a Name.
5. Snag a ship.

## Class {.colbefore}

> "In retrospect, putting a map showing how to get back to Earth on those

> [*An Oral History of the 2320-2324 Pioneer War*]{.credit}

Your **Class** determines your starting attributes and pools, and
gives you a choice of Talents. Pick a class from this list:

- **Apollo** You're big, strong, and tough in a fight.
- **Mercury** You're fast, agile, and hard to pin down.
- **Gemini** You're smart, clever, and good with technology.
- **Soyuz** You're a jack-of-all-trades who is pretty good at everything.

### Earth Orbit

Earth is home to the vast majority of the human race, and is surrounded by large
orbital colonies in Low Earth Orbit.

Luna is the second most populated colony and is primarily technological workers.
It's also the communications hub of the Solar System ... or at least, it *was*.

Located in the La Grange 5 point, O'Neill Station is the largest orbital colony 
in the Solar System.

for their shipbuilding.

Ceres is the largest and most populous planetoid in the asteroid belt.

Six classes of pions have been positively identified, although there may be
more as yet unseen.

- **Cassini** Diplomat
- **Mariner** Troop transport
- **Rover** Infantry
- **Ulysses** Commander
- **Venera** Air Support
- **Viking** Marine

### Cassini

The only pions who have verbally spoken with humans. Roughly humanoid,
slender, eight feet tall, and with clear domes over their blinking cybernetic
brains. They're the spokesrobots for the Occupation.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 5
- **Vulnerable** pulse
- **Finger Lasers** *close, mid* Harm 2, Burn 
- **Moves** Issue threats, call for help, strategic withdrawal
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Mariner

The largest of the non-vessel Pions, they're less like individual robots 
and more like small shuttlecraft used as troop transports.
Their rectangular bodies are the size of a large 
truck and have fore- and aft-facing cannons. 

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 20 (Ship-2)
- **Vulnerable** explosive
- **Thunder Cannons** *mid, far* Harm 4, Exploding
- **Moves** Lift off, disgorge troops, hover precipitously
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Rover

These pions are about the size of a large dog; their six wheels are made to 
fold inward, or extend to maneuver over obstacles. They're the rank-and-file
infantry of the Occupation.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 4
- **Vulnerable** explosive
- **Slugthrowers** *close, mid* Harm 1
- **Moves** Swarm the humans, obey orders, breach defenses
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Ulysses

The Ulysses pions are the command-and-control leaders of pion ground forces,
including the rovers and the vikings. They're shaped like six-legged mechanical
spiders about the size of a small car, with sensors in all directions.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 7
- **Vulnerable** pulse
- **Micro-scramjet Swarms** *all* Harm 4, Exploding
- **Moves** Analyze tactics, coordinate troops, missile lock
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Venera

Venera pions are the air support for ground operations, offering eye-in-the-sky
intelligence reports to those on the ground. They look the most like old NASA
probes of any pions, resembling armored viking orbiters.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 6
- **Vulnerable** burn
- **Focused Microwave Pulse** *close, mid* Harm 2, Burn
- **Moves** Transmit tactical telemetry, evasive maneuvers, crash and burn
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Viking

The viking-class pions are the most feared by resistance fighters, as they're
the heavy troopers of the Ooccupation. Reinforced weapon mounts surround a cylindrical
central body mounted on 12 flexible legs of variegrated size.

::::::::::::::::::: infolist :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
- **Health** 9
- **Vulnerable** *nothing known*
- **Overkill Onslaught** *close, mid* Harm 5
- **Moves** Take the beachhead, support mission objective, go down fighting

## Ships {.breakbefore}

### Ship Fights

Ship fights work exactly like normal fights, except that instead of using
your character's Thrust, Gyro, or Telemetry, you use the ship's.

If a ship is destroyed, anyone on board is KIA unless the ship has the EVA
tag or Escape Pods.

## Resistance Ops {.breakbefore}

[]{.lorem}

### Op Types

There are three basic Op types:

- Planetary Ops
- Orbital Ops
- Combined Ops

### Preparing for the Mission

### Travel Time

Obviously, the Solar System is huge. With realistic travel times,
it could take years to get from one side of it to another.
If the travel time ever matters, here are some approximate values
you can use.

- Travel between Earth and O'Neill Station takes 1d6 hours,
  as does travel between Earth and Luna.

- For travel within the inner planets -- Mercury to Mars -- roll
  1d6 for the travel time, in days. Add 2 days for travel to or
  from Ceres.

- For travel from the inner planets to the outer planets, roll
  1d6 days and add the base travel time from the table below.

Outer Planet Base Travel Time
---          ----
Jupiter       1 week
Saturn        2 weeks
Uranus        5 weeks (1 month)
Neptune       8 weeks (2 months)
Pluto        11 weeks (3 months)
Eris         19 weeks (4 months)

- For travel between two outer planets, use the higher base travel
  time, plus 1d6 weeks.

- Travel time between moons of the same outer planet takes 1d6 hours.
