# PIONEERS

### We created the Pions.

### We sent Them before Us.

### And followed Them to Space.

### We gave Them Life.

### They gave Us the Planets.

### We gave Them a Galaxy to Explore.

### We never Imagined ...

### ... They would Want to Return.

In *Pioneers*, you fight to liberate the Solar System from the Pions,
cybernetic beings who have already conquered the Earth and much of the
Solar System, and nuked the Moon. You know, as one does.

*Pioneers* was created as part of the [LUMEN Jam](https://itch.io/jam/lumen-jam)
hosted by [Gila RPGs](https://gilarpgs.itch.io/).
