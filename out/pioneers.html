<p>In <span class="gamename"></span>, you fight to liberate the Solar System from the Pions, cybernetic beings who have already conquered the Earth and much of the Solar System and nuked the Moon. You know, as one does.</p>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> is a tabletop roleplaying game for 3-6 players. One player takes on the role of <strong>Mission Control</strong> (or, <em>the MC</em> for short) and controls <strong>the Pions</strong> – humanity’s prodigal, digital children who have returned from the depths of space with technology far beyond that of 24th Century Earth.</p>
<p>The each of other players creates a <strong>Survivor</strong> who is part of the <strong>Rag-Tag Fugitive Resistance</strong> striving to free the Solar System from the crushing <strong>Occupation</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="toc-intro">Saving the Worlds</h2>
<p>As member of the Resistance, your Survivor is part of a small cell of 2 to 5 freedom fighters that undertake missions, called <strong>Ops</strong>, that invariably involve blowing up lots and lots of murderous robots – on Earth, in space, or on one of the <strong>Twelve Colonies of Man</strong> scattered across the conquered Solar System.</p>
<p>If you survive a deadly Op, the most you can hope for is a free drink in one of the underground speak-easies frequented by the Resistance fighters; if you fail, the best you’ll get is one of those drinks lifted in honor of your sacrifice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In retrospect, putting a map showing how to get back to Earth on those old-fashioned space probes probably wasn’t the smartest idea.” <span class="credit"><em>An Oral History of the 2320-2324 Pioneer War</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Survivor has three abilities: <strong>Thrust</strong>, <strong>Gyro</strong>, and <strong>Telemetry</strong>.</p>
<p>You use <strong>Thrust</strong> for direct actions – to solve problems that are best solved by an application of force, whether physical or mental.</p>
<p><strong>Gyro</strong> is all about speed and balance. If it has to be done quickly, gracefully, or both, then you’re going to make a Gyro roll.</p>
<p><strong>Telemetry</strong> covers anything requiring knowlege, whether that’s the specialized knowledge of a hacker or surgeon, or just general intelligence about the enemy’s movement.</p>
<h3 id="toc-pools" class="colbefore">Resource Pools</h3>
<p>In addition, you have three resource pools, <strong>Health</strong>, <strong>Impulse</strong>, and <strong>Kit</strong>. At the start of each Op, your resource pools are set to their maximum value; while the exact value will go up or down during the Op, you can’t go over your maximum value.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong> tells you how much Harm your Survivor can take before being KIA; each hit by the enemy usually does 1 to 3 Harm.</p>
<p><strong>Impulse</strong> is your energy, your drive, your momentum. Your class gives you Talents that you can activate using Impulse.</p>
<p><strong>Kit</strong> is an abstract measure of how much gear you have. At the beginning of each Op, you adjust your inventory by expending points from your Kit; you can also spend Kit in the field, to represent items that you had on you but didn’t want to slow the game down with time-consuming inventory tracking.</p>
<h3 id="toc-dice" class="colbefore">Rolling the Dice</h3>
<p>When you do an action, either in a fight or not, state which attribute you’re using, then roll a number of six-sided dice equal to your score in that attribute. Check the highest number you rolled on one die against the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;">On a…</th>
<th></th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td>The action <strong>succeeds</strong> but there’s a <strong>complication</strong>.</td>

<h3 id="toc-gear-other" class="colbefore">Other Items</h3>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> isn’t a subtle game. You get a mission, go in, kill robots, and get out. There’s not a lot of room for the niceties – your Survivors are Resistance freedom fighters constantly on the run. There’s not a need for specialized equipment. We assume your Survivor has the basics to do their jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clothes and a Backpack</strong></li>
<li><strong>A Toolkit</strong> for basic repairs</li>
<li><strong>Water/Rations</strong> dried “astronaut food”</li>
<li><strong>A Map</strong> of the mission area</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need anything else, you can spend 1 Kit before or during the mission to say you brought it with you.</p>
<h4 id="toc-gear-med-patch" class="colbefore">Med Patch</h4>
<p>Med patches are one-shot sources of Health that are in high demand but limited quantities among the Resistance.</p>
<p>When they take their turn, a Survivor can use one on themselves or on another Survivor – this doesn’t use up their opportunity to attack during a turn, although they can only use one Med Patch each turn.</p>
<p>A Med Patch heals 1 Health and then is used up.</p>

<p>“I fuckin’ hate these goddamn space probes. ‘Explore the universe and report back’ – fuck that, does us no damn good down here on planet Earth. Earth first, always.” <span class="credit"><em>An Oral History of the 2320-2324 Pioneer War</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> is a game of violent resistance to the Occupation, so of course violence is likely to ensue. We call each instance of that a a <strong>Fight</strong>.</p>
<p>In a fight, the players and the MC alternate turns – each of the players gets to have their Survivor do something, and then the MC takes a turn for the Pions.</p>
<h3 id="toc-range">Range Bands</h3>
<p>Unlike some tabletop RPGs, <span class="gamename"></span> is not concerned with exact position and distance; instead, participants in a fight are classified as being in <em>close</em>, <em>mid</em>, or <em>far</em> range, relative to the other combatants. This affects the effectiveness of most weapons and can interact with class’s Talents.</p>
<h3 id="toc-turn-player">Player Turns</h3>
<p>On the the players’ turn, they can act in whatever order they like, until every player has had to chance to act.</p>
<p>When it’s your turn, you can do any or all of these:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Change your Range Band</strong> by one – <em>close</em> to <em>mid</em>, <em>mid</em> to <em>close</em> or <em>far</em>, or <em>far</em> to <em>mid</em>. (You can’t jump from <em>close</em> to <em>far</em> or vice versa.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make an Attack</strong> against one of the Pions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Your Talents</strong> by paying a cost from the appropriate pool. You can use as many Talents as you wish during your turn, but you can only activate each Talent once during that turn.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use an Object</strong> if you’ve picked up something interesting along the way or are carrying a <a href="#toc-gear-med-patch" class="page">med patch</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="toc-attacking" class="breakbefore">Attacking</h3>
<p>To attack, choose which weapon you’re using and which attribute you’re using for the attack – <em>Thrust</em> for a direct attack, <em>Gyro</em> for quick strikes or feints, and <em>Telemetry</em> for a steady, aimed attack – and pick your targets.</p>
<p>Roll a number of dice (d6s) equal to your score in the attribute, then compare the hightest die to the total.</p>
<p>On a <strong>5 or 6,</strong> you hit your target and do damage equal to the Harm rating of your weapon.</p>
<p>If the high score is a <strong>3 or 4,</strong> you still do the same Harm, but there’s also a <em>Complication</em>, which means the MC gets to have the Pions do something – usually doing Harm to your Health.</p>
<p>If you didn’t roll higher than a <strong>1 or 2</strong>, then you failed to Harm your target, and the MC can make a move for the Pions.</p>
<h4 id="toc-harm">Doing Harm</h4>
<p>When you successfully hit a Pion with a weapon, you do Harm equal to the weapon’s Harm score, plus other modifiers such as the weapon’s tags.</p>
<p>Most weapons do <em>untyped Harm</em>, meaning it’s not some energy type. Weapons with specific tags do <em>burn</em>, <em>exploding</em>, <em>pulse</em> or <em>shock</em> Harm.</p>
<p>If a target has a <strong>Resist</strong> tag against a type of harm, they take 1 less point of Harm from the attack. Conversely, if they have a <strong>Vulnerability</strong> to that type of harm, they take an extra 1 point of Harm.</p>
<p>Each Pion is resistant and vulnerable to different types of attacks, so it pays to switch up your tactics during a fight as you discover how it reacts to each.</p>
<h3 id="toc-turn-mc" class="breakbefore">The MC’s Turn</h3>
<p>During the MC’s turn, they can do any or all of these:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Change the Range Band</strong> for some or all of the Pions, relative to the Survivors.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a <strong>Big Change</strong> in the fight.</p></li>
<li><p>Have the <strong>Pions make moves.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Have the <strong>Pions counter-attack.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the MC’s turn, two things happen:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The MC generates Drops</strong> if any Pions were killed since the end of their last turn.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check on dying characters.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="toc-big-changes">Big Changes</h4>
<p>A Big Change means that the battle is shifting in some way – it might be that the Pions retreat to a secured location. It could be that a new, larger model of Pion arrives. The environment could be working against the Survivors – barriers slamming down, hatches opening to space, a rumbling geiser erupts.</p>
<p>The idea is not to undo the players’ hard-earned victories but to change things up so that their tactics evolve.</p>
<h4 id="toc-pion-moves">Pion Moves</h4>
<p>Each model of Pion has three “moves” listed that describe their usual tactics in battle. These aren’t just methods of attack but give a specific feel to each type of Pion – playing to these standard moves rewards the players for learning what each does, while subverting the moves can be a Big Change itself.</p>
<h4 id="toc-counter-attack" class="breakbefore">Pion Counter-Attacks</h4>
<p>Usually, the MC doesn’t need to specifically have the Pions attack; complications rolled by the players are usually enough to keep the flow of damage in both directions. However, a concentrated counter-attack could be the Big Change that the MC chooses during their turn.</p>
<p>When this happens, the MC describes the type of attack or attacks used by each enemy, and the players can describe how their Survivor is avoiding the Harm. They roll the appropriate number of dice and check the high number as always; on a 5 or 6, they escape taking any Harm; 3 or 4 they take Harm equal to half the Pion’s Harm rating; and 1 or 2 they take the full amount of Harm.</p>
<h4 id="toc-drops">Drops</h4>
<p>At the end of the MC’s turn, they one die 1d6 for each enemy that died since the end of the MC’s last turn, and check this table.</p>
<div class="drops">

</div>
<p>The players can then decide among themselves who will claim each drop. No player can exceed their maximum in a pool.`</p>
<h4 id="toc-death" class="colbefore">Death and Dying</h4>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> isn’t, broadly speaking, a happy game where the Survivors triumph and a parade is thrown in their honor. Instead, human civilization is on the brink of destruction and the Survivors’ actions can only delay an end that seems inevitable. The spectre of death hangs over each Survivor and many are haunted by what they’ve seen and done.</p>
<p>When a Survivor is reduced to 0 Health, they’re <strong>Taken Out</strong> of this fight and don’t get to act during the Survivors’ Turn step of the fight. This lasts as long as they are at 0 Health.</p>
<p>At the <strong>end of the MC’s turn</strong>, each player whose Survivor is at 0 Health rolls a die and checks the following table. If another Survivor gave first aid to the dying Survivor during their previous turn, they can roll a die as well, and the Survivor uses the best value of any die rolled.</p>

<p>By the first part of the 24th Century, mankind has left their home planet of Earth and spread throughout the Solar System.</p>
<p>The first surface colonies on the Moon and Mars were soon joined by orbital colonies in long, rotating spheres or wide, cirling toruses, housing up to several million people. Even more remote settlements were built in asteroids or buried into the surface of terrestrial planets.</p>
<p>Beginning with Mars and then Ceres, some colonies were granted independence, allowing them to function as the equivalent of national governments. The costly and asymmetrical Colonial War of the 2270s granted independence to all human colonies outside of the Earth’s orbit.</p>
<h3 id="toc-location-tags" class="breakbefore">Location Tags</h3>
<p>These are tags that apply to locations within the Solar System that can be used to give MCs and players an idea as to what any particular planet or satellite is like, as well as the level of Pion influence.</p>

<p>Earth is home to the vast majority of the human race, and is surrounded by large orbital colonies in Low Earth Orbit used for farming.</p>
<p>Luna is the second most populated colony and is primarily technological workers. It’s also the communications hub of the Solar System … or at least, it <em>was</em>, until key stations were struck by Pion nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Located in the La Grange L5 point, O’Neill Station is the largest orbital colony in the Solar System. McKendree Station, O’Neill’s sister station, was cataclysmically destroyed in 2150 in the largest space disaster in human history – with over 2 million humans dying instantly.</p>

<h3 id="toc-location-inner" class="breakbefore">Inner Planets</h3>
<p>Mercury is a very hot planet on the side facing the sun, and a very cold planet on the side facing away from the sun. Low-scale mining takes place there, plus solar batteries store photonic energy for shipment throughout the Solar System.</p>
<p>Venus has floating cloud cities occupied by the wealthy above, and gas miners on the lower decks. The atmosphere remains poisonous to human lungs, but extensive glass walls give the Venusian colonies the appearance of domed cities.</p>
<p>Mars is the most populous and oldest colony in the Solar System. Its two moons are known for their shipbuilding, although both have been seized by the Pions and are being refitted to produce Pion craft instead.</p>
<p>Ceres is the largest and most populous planetoid in the asteroid belt. Once the site of a major mining operation, the asteroid is honeycombed with occupied tunnels and caverns. Ceres serves as the capital of the Asteroid Belt and prior to the coming of the Pions was a major transit port between the Inner Planets and the Outer Planets.</p>

<p>After Earth and Mars, Jupiter is the most populated planetary system in the Solar System. No one dwells on the gas giant, of course, but all but one of Jupiter’s largest moons are home to Earth colonies.</p>
<p>Europa is known for the indigenous life forms in its chilly seas – a primitive form of life akin to brine shrimp – that was the source of the first extraterrestial life found by humans. Europa is currently under a crushing Pion blockade, but to date, they have attempted no landings there.</p>
<p>Cleomestra Station orbits Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System; the Station is the second most distant orbital colony from Earth. Prior to occupation by the Pions, Ganymede was a commerce port, centered on the ice-mining trade.</p>
<p>Callisto’s surface is dotted with numerous small manufacturing facilities, many of them almost entirely automated, that are actively being bombarded by Pion <em>Sakigake</em> ships.</p>

<p>Even in the 24th Century, the ringed giant remains widely acknowledged as among the most breathtaking locations in the Solar System. Of Saturn’s many moons, only Titan and Enceledas have sizeable populations, with Rhea being a research station.</p>
<p>The methane-based native life forms of Titan are found in its icy methane seas and are massive, ponderous creatures somewhere between a coral colony and enormous whales. Idaea Station, which orbits Titan, is the furthest orbital colony from Earth and was built using materials mined on Jupiter’s moon Ganymede rather than on ores mined in the asteroid belt.</p>
<p>Enceledus’s colony is the oldest among Saturn’s moons, and one of the few sources of liquid water in the outer planets.</p>

<p>Pluto is the second most distant human colony and is primary for astronomical research; in 2309, they detected anomalous radio signals from the vicinity of Episilon Eridani that continue to defy human explanation. The sub-surface astro-colony was the first human settlement to encounter the returning Pions. Pluto fell to their troops and went radio-silent a full three days before the attack on Luna, although few seemed to seem to care at the time.</p>
<p>Eris is on the farthest edge of the Solar System and is a mining penal colony. Its remoteness let it escape Pion notice; with the occupation of Earth, the prison’s wardens soon lost control of the inmates, who seized control of the distant colony.

<h2 id="step-ship" class="breakbefore">Ships</h2>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> isn’t just a game that takes place on the surface of planets – there’s just as much that happens in the dark void of space.</p>
<p>Instead of the players all serving as crew on one large ship, each Survivor has access to one ship, randomly determined at character creation.</p>
<p>This section presents general rules on spacecraft and ship-to-ship combat; for examples of ships, read about the <a href="#toc-fleet" class="page">rag-tag fugitive fleet</a> and the <a href="#toc-pion-ships" class="page">Pion ships</a> in later sections.</p>

<li><strong>Thrust</strong> Which works as the personal attribute, but for the ship.</li>
<li><strong>Gyro</strong> Also works as the personal attribute.</li>
<li><strong>Telemetry</strong> And also the same as the personal attribute.</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong> Ships are rated with Ship-Health scores; each Ship-Health point is equal to 10 personal Health points. Things that heal Ship-Health can’t heal personal Health, and vice versa. Ship-Health is lost only to weapons that do Ship-Harm.</li>
<li><strong>Resist and Vulnerable</strong> Ships resistant to certain attacks take 1 less Ship-Harm from those attacks, while those vulnerable to such attacks take 1 more Ship-Harm.</li>

<li><strong>Tags</strong> Like weapon tags and system tags, ship tags give a ship new abilities. At the start or end of an op, a player can spend 2 Kit to swap 1 Tag for another.</li>

<h2 id="toc-pion-ships" class="breakbefore">Pion Spacecraft</h2>
<p>Pion ships are essentially huge, self-piloting robot vehicles; each is controlled by redundant central computers, and has no separate pilot.</p>
<p>The five known types of Pion ships are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genesis</strong> Worldship</li>
<li><strong>Kosmos</strong> Carrier</li>
<li><strong>Mariner</strong> Troop transport and lander</li>
<li><strong>Sakigake</strong> Artillery Ship</li>
<li><strong>Zond</strong> Interdictor</li>
</ul>
<div class="infolist">
<h3 id="toc-pion-ship-genesis" class="colbefore">Genesis</h3>
<p>Only one of these is ships is known to exist, and that’s fortunate. Nearly the size of O’Neill Station, <em>Genesis</em> is a mobile battlestation that was at first mistaken for a small natural satellite, but this is no moon.</p>
<p><em>Genesis</em> is only found in Earth orbit or nearby.</p>

<li><strong>Vulnerable</strong> <em>nothing</em></li>
<li><strong>Ship-to-Ship Defense Batteries</strong> <em>close-ship</em> Harm Ship-2, Burn</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="infolist">
<h3 id="toc-pion-ship-kosmos" class="colbefore">Kosmos</h3>
<p>A total of 8 <em>Kosmos</em> carriers have been identified by Resistance Intel Officers. One is in Earth orbit, and another in Lunar orbit. Every human colony under a blockade – Ceres, Europa, and Titan – has a <em>Kosmos</em> craft stationed nearby, and three more prowl the reaches of the Solar System.</p>
<p>Their primary function is akin to an aircraft carrier. They have facilities for creating and launching the <em>Zond</em> attack interceptor craft, and landing facilities for those and other Pion ships, including hangars for <em>Mariners.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health</strong> Ship-50</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerable</strong> burn</li>
<li><strong>Electrostatic Defense Field Generators</strong> <em>close-ship</em> Harm Ship-2, AOE, Shock</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="infolist">
<h3 id="toc-pion-ship-mariner" class="colbefore">Mariner</h3>
<p><em>Mariners</em> are the smallest of the Pion ships, even smaller than the <em>Zonds.</em> Unlike most spacecraft, they <em>can</em> be affected by personal-level weaponry; see the section on planetary Pions <a href="#toc-pion-mariner" class="page">for their stats in a personal context</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to transporting troops, <em>Mariners</em> also move Cassini-class Pions and valuable human prisoners within planetary systems. They’re found throughout the Solar System.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health</strong> Ship-2</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerable</strong> explosive</li>
<li><strong>Attack</strong> <em>none</em></li>
<li><strong>Moves</strong> Enter atmosphere, dock with capital ship, reload troops</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="infolist">
<h3 id="toc-pion-ship-sakigake" class="colbefore">Sakigake</h3>
<p>Smaller than the <em>Kosmos</em>-class carriers, <em>Sakigake</em> craft are primarily weapons of mass destruction that can attack from the edge of a planet’s orbit. They’re mostly used to shell occupied planets that get out of line and destroy infrastructure on colonies that resist traditional occupation. <em>Sakigakes</em> are found wherever the Pions are actively besieging a colony – Mercury, Luna, and Callisto.</p>
<p>At least two dozen <em>Sakigake</em> are known to exist; they usually travel in pairs, with <em>Zond</em> escorts. Although they pack a devastating punch, <em>Sakigakes</em> are, relatively speaking, glass cannons.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health</strong> Ship-10</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerable</strong> pulse</li>
<li><strong>Laser Bombardment Cannons</strong> <em>far-ship</em> Harm Ship-6, AOE, Burn, Reload</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="infolist">
<h3 id="toc-pion-ship-zond" class="colbefore">Zond</h3>
<p><em>Zond</em>-class craft are agile and deadly interceptor craft that hunt in packs like wolves or sharks. They’re most frequently encountered near <em>Kosmos</em> carriers or <em>Genesis</em>, although they can be found as escorts for any other Pion craft.</p>
<p>Their inability to function in any kind of atmosphere is the only factor limiting their deadliness. Resistance pilots using <a href="#toc-fleet-shuttle" class="page">shuttles</a> or <a href="#toc-fleet-racing-yacht" class="page">racing yachts</a> have learned to ditch their <em>Zond</em> pursuers with a dive into an atmosphere – even one that’s not breathable by humans.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health</strong> Ship-4</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerable</strong> shock</li>
<li><strong>Pulsed Maser Cannon</strong> <em>close-ship, mid-ship</em> Harm Ship-2, Pulse</li>
<li><strong>Moves</strong> Concentrate on the leader, break off attack, suicide run</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="toc-mc" class="breakbefore">Mission Control</h2>
<p>If you’re playing as Mission Control instead of creating and playing a Survivor, you’ve got an important role in the game – but it’s <em>not</em> to kill the other players’ Survivor characters.</p>
<p>Think of yourself less like the players’ opponents and more like a director or producer – you give the players challenges that their Survivors can overcome, but you’re still rooting for them to win in the end.</p>
<p>In your role, you can control the pacing and difficulty of the game more directly than the other players can. As a consequence, you shouldn’t grow that attached to your own Pions – they only exist to put up a token amount of threat and then get mowed down by the Survivors.</p>
<h3 id="rotating-mcs" class="colbefore">Rotating MCs</h3>
<p><span class="gamename"></span> is a very <em>episodic</em> game, meaning that there aren’t really storylines and plots that run from one Op to the next.</p>
<p>That makes it to switch roles between Ops; for many groups, it makes sense for a player to take on the MC role for one mission, and then pass it on to another player at the end of an Op.</p>
<p>This is how we recommend you play the game – it gives everyone a chance to experience the game from two different sides, and all the players get to make up Survivors! Character creation can be a fun mini-game.</p>
<h3 id="toc-mc-why" class="colbefore">The Question of <em>Why?</em></h3>
<p>You might notice that nowhwere in <span class="gamename"></span> do we actually explain <em>why</em> the Pions are doing this. That’s deliberate, not an oversight!</p>
<p>In the TV shows and movies <a href="#toc-credits" class="page">that inspired this game</a>, such as 2004’s <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, attempts to explain the backstories of the villains usually made the shows worse, not better.</p>
<p>If it’s going to make a difference in the way you play, then of course you can make something up – we’re not stopping you! But ultimately <span class="gamename"></span> just isn’t a game about understanding the motives of your enemies but about breaking evil robots, so that’s what the game does.</p>
<p>We also don’t offer an explanation of why the Pions haven’t wiped out humanity and are instead trying to conquerer and control Earth and her colonies. Also deliberate, and for the same reason!</p>
<p>If the players bring this up during the game, just smile knowingly and say something vague, like, “Hmm, that <em>is</em> mysterious, isn’t it?” If you’re one of those players reading this and the issue arises later, either play along with the MC or make up some ridiculous cockamamie explanation. Hey, maybe it’s true in <em>your</em> game, right?</p>
<h3 id="toc-mc-rp">Roleplaying the Pions</h3>
<p>Unlike many roleplaying games, interactions between the player characters and non-player characters don’t play a huge role in <span class="gamename"></span> – the preceeding section explains why!</p>
<p>The <a href="#toc-pion-cassini" class="page">Cassini model</a> are the only Pions who talk, so when one of those shows up – and they’re found in most Pion bases – feel free to play them to the hilt. They’re meant to be the exact opposite of the alien, non-communicative types that make up the vast majority of the Pions. Cassinis are snide, taunting, and duplicitous.</p>
<p>You can also roleplay the other Pions without having them speak directly. Describe how their sensors track the Survivors with stony indifference. Give them unfamiliar beeps and electronic squawks as they die; just make sure they’re implacably inscrutable.</p>
<h2 id="toc-ops" class="breakbefore">Resistance Ops</h2>
<p>The basic cycle of a <span class="gamename"></span> looks like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The players create Survivors.</li>
<li>Survivors are assigned an Op with a specific mission.</li>
<li>Survivors prepare for the Op and get in position.</li>
<li>One or more fights ensue on the way to completing that mission.</li>
<li>Survivors leave, bury their dead, and recover.</li>
<li>Back to 2, until the players are satisfied with the game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Survivor creation is <a href="#toc-chargen" class="page">covered in a previous section</a>; this section will tell you how to send those Survivors on those dangerous missions where they might get killed.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, there are three kinds of Ops: <strong>Planetary Ops</strong> that take place on the surface of a planet or moon; <strong>Space Ops</strong> that happen in spacecraft; and <strong>Combined Ops</strong>.</p>
<p>Each has their own unique qualities, and in general it’s more fun to have variety in Op types.</p>
<p>Most Survivors’ Talents are directly tied to personal-scale fights, and those should be the emphasis of a <span class="gamename"></span> – but not exclusively.</p>
<p>The bottom of this page has a chart you can use before an Op to determine what type of mission it will it. Have one player roll a die and then crossreference the last type of Op you completed with the die roll, then check the following sections for specific Op scenarios!</p>
<h4 id="toc-ops-planetary" class="colbefore">Planetary Ops</h4>
<p>On these missions, Survivors are tasked with carrying out an Op on the surface of a planet or moon. Their gear will be adapted to function in such an environment, if necessary – for example, missions to Mars will include O<sub>2 tanks and filters.</p>

<h4 id="toc-ops-combined" class="colbefore">Combined Ops</h4>
<p>Specialized gear for use on a surface will be issued to the Survivors, as per planetary ops. At no cost in Kit, a player can choose to have a vacsuit on their ship for this mission, and can switch between that and their normal armor during a lull in the action.</p>
<p>Use the following table to decide the mission paramters for an Op that has both Planetary and Space objectives.</p>

<h3 id="toc-ops-prep" class="colbefore">Mission Prep</h3>
<p>Survivors’ Health, Impulse, and Kit pools reset before an Op. Each player can make a prep roll before an Op to prepare for the upcoming mission using an attribute of their choice. The appropriate pool – and its maximum value – increases by 1 for the entirety of this Op.</p>

<p>Before each mission, players roll to see which weapons, armor, other gear, and ships they have access to during this Op. Any Survivor who has customized their weapon or ship can keep that from their last Op and doesn’t have to roll.</p>
<p>Right before an Op, a Survivor can spend Kit (and only Kit) to change out their gear for another choice on the appropriate table. Survivors without a Med Patch can also spend 1 Kit to grab a Med Patch – but no Survivor can have more than one at the start of an Op; they’re too rare among the Resistance and are heavily rationed.</p>
<h3 id="toc-ops-travel">Travel Time</h3>
<p>Obviously, the Solar System is huge. With realistic travel times, it could take years to get from one side of it to another. If the travel time ever matters, here are some approximate values you can use.</p>
<div class="traveltimes infotable">
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<p>Travel between Earth and O’Neill Station takes 1d6 hours, as does travel between Earth and Luna.</p>
<p>For travel within the inner planets – Mercury to Mars – roll 1d6 for the travel time, in days. Add 2 days for travel to or from Ceres.</p>
<p>For travel from the inner planets to the outer planets, roll 1d6 days and add the base travel time from the table below.</p>
<p>For travel between two outer planets, use the higher base travel time, plus 1d6 weeks.</p>
<p>Travel time between moons of the same outer planet takes 1d6 hours.</p>
<h3 id="when-an-op-is-over">When an Op is Over</h3>
<p>An Op concludes when the Survivors have finished an Op, or when at least one of them has died and the players decide to scrub the mission and return home.</p>
<h3 id="toc-ops-post" class="colbefore">Post-Op Recuperation</h3>
<p>After an Op, the Survivors retreat to a hidden base to await further orders from the Resistance.</p>
<p>Any player whose Survivor died during the previous Op can create a new Survivor during Post-Op Recuperation. Likewise, any player who wishes to try a different character can make a new one during the Post-Op.</p>
<p>Pools don’t automatically refresh at the end of an Op. Survivors who have points remaining in their Kit can spend 1 point on <em>one</em> of the following options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Customize Weapons</strong> Spend 1 kit to switch 1 Tag on a weapon to a different Tag.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Customize Ship Weaponry</strong> Spend 1 kit to switch 1 ship-mounted weapon for a different ship weapon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Customize Ship Tags</strong> Spend 1 kit to switch 1 Tag on a ship for a different ship Tag.</p></li>

<p>This game is primarily an homage 1970s-era space science and science fiction.</p>
<p><em>Battlestar Galactica</em> in its original, 1978 form is a key inspiration, as well as the later 2004-2009 remake. Other influences include the obvious <em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture</em>, but also <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, <em>Space: 1999</em>, and <em>Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</em>.</p>
<p>Around 1975-1977, as a young nerd girl growing in California, I was fascinated by astronomy and the <em>science-based</em> vision of a future in space portrayed in NASA’s concept art – some of which appears in <span class="gamename"></span>! – that is, until a certain <em>space opera</em> movie came out in the summer of 1977.</p>
